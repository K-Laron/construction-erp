|---|---|
| Test Suites | **10 suites, 20 tests — ALL PASSING** ✅ |
| TypeScript | **`tsc --noEmit` — CLEAN** ✅ |
| ESLint | **Configured and passing** ✅ |
| Hardcoded Credentials | **Zero** ✅ |
| Known Security Vulnerabilities | **Zero** ✅ |
| Encrypted Data Key Derivation | **All use derived keys** ✅ |
| Ledger Integrity | **HMAC-chained with timestamps** ✅ |

---

## Severity Definitions

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 | **Critical (C)** | Exploitable vulnerability that can cause financial loss, data tampering, or privilege escalation |
| 🟠 | **High (H)** | Security flaw or data-integrity risk requiring immediate remediation |
| 🟡 | **Medium (M)** | Logic error, race condition, or missing safeguard with material impact |
| 🔵 | **Low / Refactor (L/R/N)** | Code quality, type safety, maintainability, or cosmetic issues |

---

## Critical Findings

| ID | Phase | Finding | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 4 | **No server-side `unitPrice` validation** — client-supplied price accepted without verification, enabling price-tampering attacks | Server now fetches the customer's `price_tier`, validates the submitted price against the DB `selling_price` / `wholesale_price`, and throws `PRICE_TAMPERING_DETECTED` on mismatch | ✅ |
| C2 | 4 | **No server-side tax recomputation** — client-calculated tax accepted as-is, allowing tax evasion | Server recalculates tax independently: `Math.round(((computedSubtotal - discount) / 1.12) * 0.12)`; client-supplied tax value is ignored | ✅ |

---

## High Findings

| ID | Phase | Finding | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | 1–3 | **`recordPayment` allows negative balance** — overpayment subtraction can produce a negative outstanding balance | Added `MAX(0, balance - ?)` guard to prevent negative balances | ✅ |
| H2 | 1–3 | **`closeShift` collections missing `cashier_id` filter** — shift summary aggregates across all cashiers | Added `WHERE cashier_id = ?` clause to scope collections to the active cashier | ✅ |
| H3 | 1–3 | **Inline 48-word mnemonic list** — insufficient entropy for key generation (~56 bits) | Replaced with BIP-39 2048-word `wordlist.json` providing 2¹³² entropy | ✅ |
| H4 | 1–3 | **No discount cap** — any discount amount accepted without authorization | `verifyOverride()` now required for any discount > 0 | ✅ |
| H5 | 1–3 | **No PIN length enforcement** — trivially short PINs accepted | PINs shorter than 6 digits are rejected at input | ✅ |
| H2 (backup) | 4 | **Backup reuses raw MLEK** — master key used directly, no key separation | Backup now uses `pbkdf2Sync` with a dedicated `'backup_derivation_salt'` to derive a separate key | ✅ |
| H4 (overpayment) | 4 | **Overpayment clamped to zero** — `MAX(0, ...)` prevented credit balances from being recorded | Removed the `MAX(0, ...)` clamp; credit balances are now allowed and tracked correctly | ✅ |
| H1 | 6 | **Hardcoded admin PIN `123456`** — default credential present in bootstrap code | Cryptographically random 6-digit PIN generated at first bootstrap, displayed once to the operator, never stored in plaintext | ✅ |
| H2 | 6 | **Unencrypted temp DB on disk** — `VACUUM INTO` wrote an unencrypted copy to a predictable path | Temp file now written to `os.tmpdir()` with a UUID filename; cleanup in a `finally` block guarantees deletion | ✅ |
| H3 | 6 | **System daemon zero hash** — daemon user record created with an all-zeros hash and salt | `crypto.randomBytes(32)` for hash and `crypto.randomBytes(8)` for salt at daemon creation | ✅ |

---

## Medium Findings

| ID | Phase | Finding | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M4 | 1–3 | **`window.confirm()` on delivery actions** — native browser dialog with no styling or UX control | Replaced with a dedicated `Modal` component | ✅ |
| M5 | 1–3 | **Worker thread fails on `:memory:` DB** — SQLite worker cannot share in-memory databases | Worker path skipped for in-memory DBs; query runs inline on the main thread | ✅ |
| M2 | 4 | **No dispatch stock pre-check** — dispatch proceeds without verifying remaining deliverable quantities | `getDeliveryRemainingItems()` called before dispatch to validate stock | ✅ |
| M4 | 4 | **Session password fixed / predictable** — static session secret in development mode | `crypto.randomBytes(32)` generated per boot in dev; `SESSION_PASSWORD` environment variable enforced in production | ✅ |
| M1 | 6 | **18 `as any` type casts** — suppressed type checking across the codebase | Reduced to the minimal necessary set (DB row returns, test mocks) | ✅ |
| M2 | 6 | **14 unused imports** — dead imports across `src/app/actions` and `src/lib` | Comprehensive cleanup performed | ✅ |
| M3 | 6 | **TOCTOU in delivery validation** — remaining-quantity check and dispatch were not atomic | `remaining_qty` checks moved inside `db.transaction()` to eliminate the race window | ✅ |
| M4 | 6 | **Rate-limit race condition** — fail-count read and increment were separate operations | Fail-count check and `login_attempts` INSERT now execute within the same transaction | ✅ |
| M5 | 6 | **No structured error returns** — server actions threw raw exceptions to the client | All server actions wrapped in `try/catch`, returning `{ success, data?, error? }` | ✅ |
| M6 | 6 | **Missing input validation on shifts** — negative amounts and no-op updates accepted silently | Shifts validate non-negative amounts; deactivate functions check `info.changes` before committing | ✅ |

## Low / Refactor / Normalization Findings

| ID | Phase | Finding | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | 1–3 | **`cashierId` not defined in `processReturn`** — runtime reference error | Mapped to `processedBy` parameter | ✅ |
| R2 | 1–3 | **Phantom `getMlekSecret` import** — TypeScript import for a non-existent function | Removed the dead import | ✅ |
| N1 | 5 | **VAT-exempt checkout not supported** — all transactions taxed regardless of customer status | `transactions.ts` now fetches `is_vat_exempt` flag and skips tax calculation when set | ✅ |
| N2 | 5 | **`processReturn` accumulated totals** — multiple GL entries created for a single return | Consolidated into a single GL reversal entry | ✅ |
| N3 | 5 | **Z-Reading does not split voids/returns** — void and return totals merged in shift report | Separated in `shifts.ts:81-92` | ✅ |
| N4 | 5 | **MLEK logic duplicated across files** — encryption key code copy-pasted in 6 locations | Extracted to shared `src/lib/mlek.ts`; all 6 consumers now import from it | ✅ |
| N5 | 5 | **`(global as any).__activeUserId`** — global mutation for user context | Replaced with `getActiveUserId()` accessor from the auth module | ✅ |
| N6 | 5 | **`getTransactionDetails` untyped** — return type was implicit `any` | Typed as `Promise<{ transaction, items }>` | ✅ |
| N8 | 5 | **`HAVING` without `GROUP BY`** — invalid SQL in deliveries query | Rewritten as a CTE in `deliveries.ts` | ✅ |
| N9 | 5 | **Dead parameter in `processReturn`** — 3rd argument unused | Reduced to 2 parameters | ✅ |
| R1 | 5 | **Missing `description` in `customer_ledger` INSERT** — column omitted from insert statement | Added the missing column | ✅ |
| R2 | 5 | **Inline HMAC bypass** — ad-hoc HMAC computation instead of shared utility | All call sites now use `calculateHMACSignature()` consistently | ✅ |
| — | 5 | **`getTransactions` untyped** | Return type added | ✅ |
| — | 5 | **`datetime('now')` inconsistency** — mixed timestamp functions across 14 files | Standardized to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` across the codebase | ✅ |
| — | 5 | **No stock audit trail** — inventory adjustments not logged | IN/OUT movements now recorded in `system_audit_logs` | ✅ |
| — | 5 | **`JournalLineInput` type missing** — journal entry lines used raw objects | `JournalLineInput` type added and applied | ✅ |
| L1 | 6 | **`console.log` in production** — debug output leaks to browser console | Gated behind `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` | ✅ |
| L2 | 6 | **`@ts-ignore` for `__webpack_require__`** — suppressed compiler error without explanation | Addressed (webpack-specific intrinsic handled properly) | ✅ |
| L3 | 6 | **Row spread leaks encrypted fields** — spreading a DB row into a response object could expose cipher-text columns | Explicit field mapping applied in `customers.ts` | ✅ |
| L4 | 6 | **No component tests** — zero front-end test coverage | Tests added for `PaymentModal`, `POSRegister`, and `CheckoutModal` | ✅ |
| L6 | 6 | **No PWA support** — application not installable on devices | `manifest.json`, `sw.js`, and `PWA.tsx` component added | ✅ |

## Phase 7–8: Type Safety & Final Polish

| Area | Finding | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | Compiler errors present | **Zero errors** — `tsc --noEmit` passes cleanly | ✅ |
| ESLint | No linting configured | ESLint configured and all rules passing | ✅ |
| Error Boundaries | Unhandled render errors crash the app | `ErrorBoundary` component wraps the dashboard | ✅ |
| Server Actions | Mixed return shapes | All server actions return structured `{ success, data?, error? }` | ✅ |

---

## Phase 9: Production Readiness Hardening

| Area | Finding | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Observability | console.log output without Trace IDs | Configured structured single-line JSON logs in production with request context `x-trace-id` extraction | ✅ |
| Backup Resilience | No integrity check on DB exports | Export check mounts the backup copy using a dry-run connection and queries `PRAGMA integrity_check` before encrypting | ✅ |
| Key Security | MLEK indefinitely resident in memory | Implemented a 30-minute inactivity auto-lock that zero-fills and purges `mlekSecret` from process memory | ✅ |
| Input Boundaries | Mutating Server Actions lack validation | Wrapped customer, inventory, purchase order, delivery, and shift actions in strict Zod schema validation | ✅ |
